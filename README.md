# reactjs-notes-list

I am learning how to use react and redux and styling with sass

## How start the App

- git clone git@github.com:code-in-time/reactjs-notes-list.git
- cd reactjs-notes-list
- npm install
- npm start

## Planning notes are here

- Doc/Planning/Planning_a_notes_list_REDUX.png

### environment variables

- The file  (.envDOTlocal) is here so that the local setting can be saved in version control.
- To override variable create a file called .env.local (copy and rename .envDOTlocal).
- Only overdie the variables that must be custom.
- .env.local will not be saved in version control.
- Server must be stoped and restarted.
